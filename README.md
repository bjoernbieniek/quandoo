Ugly Aliens Sorter
====================

Aliens Sorter (TM) processes a list of alien species, sorts them by planet of origin and writes in a planet-specific format to the output file.
It uses ```aliens.csv``` as input and produces ```planets.csv```

Aliens Sorter is a critical piece of company's infrastructure.
Originally written by a very junior Python developer, this code is seen by some as needing at least a minor refactoring. 

Please review and improve the code if you find it somehow lacking.

## IMPORTANT!
Remember it is a critical piece of infrastructure, and some other processes rely on the output being the same in the new version.
New planets and species are constantly being discovered in the galaxy.

**Your solution should be a git archive containing your changes.**
